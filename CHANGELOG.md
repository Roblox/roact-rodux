# RoactRodux Changelog

# Unreleased Changes
* Fixed `connect` to always pass the right props, instead of sending the store to `mapDispatchToProps` ([#50](https://github.com/roblox/roact-rodux/pulls/50))

## 0.3.0 (2021-05-25)
* Added overload for function `mapDispatchToProps` to directly accept a table containing action creators [#42](https://github.com/roblox/roact-rodux/pulls/42)
* Switch to Roact's better-supported `createContext` feature [#38](https://github.com/roblox/roact-rodux/pulls/38)
* As a consequence of the above, remove `UNSTABLE_getStore` API
* Added color schemes for documentation based on user preference ([#44](https://github.com/Roblox/roact-rodux/pull/44)).
* Use Github Actions for CI

## 0.2.3 (2020-09-25)
* Removed the temporary newConnectionOrder config.

## 0.2.2 (2020-05-14)
* Changed order of connection to store so that Parent components are connected to the store before their children.
	* This should resolve some issues with components receiving bad combinations of props and store state.

## 0.2.1 (2020-03-20)
* Update to latest Rotriever manifest format.

## 0.2.0 (2019-10-24)
* Initial release.
